# 32-bit-2-cycle-processor
In this project, my partner and I used Logisim to create a 32-bit two-cycle processor. It is similar to MIPS, except that memory addresses represent 32-bit words instead of 8-bit bytes (word-addressed instead of byte-addressed). Also, all addresses are 24-bits wide instead of 32-bits, due to limitations in Logisim. Throughout the implementation of this project, we be made design choices that make it compatible with machine code outputs from MARS.
